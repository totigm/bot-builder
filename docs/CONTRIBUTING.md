Pull Requests are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for the projects.

Follow these practices to help you to write great pull requests.

You can use the `npm run check` or `yarn check` commands to verify warnings and errors. Then, use `npm run check:fix` or `yarn check:fix` to fix the auto-fixable errors.
